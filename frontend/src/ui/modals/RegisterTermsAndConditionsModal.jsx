              The term of this Car Rental Agreement runs from the date and hour of vehicle pickup as indicated in the individual Car Rental Agreement until the return of the vehicle to Owner and completion of all terms of this Car Rental Agreement by both Parties. The Parties may shorten or extend the estimated term of rental by mutual consent. A refund for early return is not applicable. In case of delayed return without prior notice of at least 6 hours ahead of the scheduled return time according to this agreement, the owner is eligible to consider the car as stolen. Furthermore, a fee of 250 PHP per hour will be imposed starting from the minute of the latest agreed return time. If the return delay exceeds more than 2 hours, a full daily rate as well as possible compensation for the loss of a following booking, at exactly the value of the lost booking, will be charged.
